/*
    1. we cannot create an object for the interface.
    2. the methods in the interface is only abstract class.
    3. Java doesnâ€™t have the diamond problem with classes because it disallows multiple inheritance.
    4. Interfaces provide a way to achieve multiple inheritance-like functionality without the ambiguities of the diamond problem.
    5. In Inheritance we will use the extend keywoard but in the interface wee will use implements.
    6. We cant create an object for the interface but we can create a object for the class which implements that interface.
    7. As we cant create a object for the interface so there is no constructor as well.
    8. Every values in the interface are public static and final.
    9. We can write body to the method in the interface if we use default or static.
